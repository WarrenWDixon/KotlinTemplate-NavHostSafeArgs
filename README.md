# KotlinTemplate-NavHostSafeArgs
Code Template Using Nav Host Fragment Navigation with Safe Args

This project serves as a code template for a Kotlin app based on a main activity with multiple fragments.
Navigation is done using a navigation graph implementing a navigation controller.
Safe Args are used to demonstrate passing arguments between the fragments.

This project also addresses common issues such as setting the fragment title in the action bar
and implementing BACK key navigation.

Note that as a code template there is no effort to implement a nice UI and the app is kept simple.
